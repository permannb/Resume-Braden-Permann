                    <p>I am passionate about spending time with my wife and family, enjoying the outdoors, and staying active. I find joy in mountain adventures like hunting, fishing, dirt biking, and hiking, as well as skiing, which is a favorite activity my wife and I share. Boating is another passion of mine, and I love wakeboarding and wake surfing. Staying physically healthy is important to me, and I dedicate time to lifting weights and going to the gym. As a sports enthusiast, I enjoy watching and playing basketball and football. Growing up as a small-town farm boy in Idaho instilled in me a love for hard work, which I continue to embrace while working on our family farm.</p>
